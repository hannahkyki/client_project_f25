            <h3>Make a list of what matters to you in your search.</h3>
            <p>Before beginning to apply for roles, it can be helpful to define what you're looking for in a job or internship first.</p>
            <p>Some questions to get started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What top 3 'things' am I looking for? (ex: salary, mentorship, professional development)</li>
                <li>What top 5 titles am I interested in?</li>
                <li>What are my top industries?</li>
                <li>Where do I want to work? In what modality? (ex: hybrid, remote, onsite)</li>
            </ul>
